## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list 
## containing a function to:
##   1.set the value of the matrix
##   2.get the value of the matrix
##   3.set the value of the matrix inverse
##   4.get the value of the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
    
}

## cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with
## makeCacheMatrix() function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse
## has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and
## skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
	## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
